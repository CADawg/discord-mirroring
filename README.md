# discord-mirroring
Mirror discord messages from another account

Since discord on mobile doesn't support multiple accounts, this will let you access another account through your second account. Using your own account/ a non-bot account is against discords ToS so I strongly suggest you use a real bot which you obtained from discord developers, but I won't stop you.

Requirements:
User bot:
- discord.py-self

Real Bot:
- discord.py

Copy `config.example.ini` to `config.ini` and add your token.


## Commands:

`!link` - first in the controlling server (where you'll use your second account) and then again in the server you want it to recognise usernames from. This allows you to hide your second accounts' true username if done properly.

You can `!link` as many pairs of channels as you want
